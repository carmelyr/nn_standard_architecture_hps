X_train and y_train are the training data with dimension 

\- X_train: 106 samples (time series) x 1201 timesteps (length of time series)

\- y_train: 106 class labels x 1 (class 0 = no stimulus, 1 = ozone application)

X_test and  y_test have similar dimensions but only 48 samples (time series).

The classes are balanced, e.g., the same number of samples for class 0 and class 1.
